function mrQ=mrQ_SEIR_bb(mrQ)
% we found the registration is often failing (causing a bias in the T1 fit
% in following steps). A possible solution is to re-align (and then re-fit)
% the SEIR, with a different IT image as the target of the registration. To
% monitor that, we register according to the first TI, and then check the
% registration using the funcction mrQ_QuantAnts. The check is not optimal
% and is using a somewhat arbitrary threshold. if the check doesn't pass
% the threshold - we reallign, fit and register spgr to the new fit - and
% then check again. if non of the trials pass our threshold, we ask the
% user to mannually check the registration, and if it is satisfying one can
% easilly bypass out checks using, for example, rerun mrQ with the
% additional input {'seir_done',1}: 
% mrQ_run(inputDir,outDir,[],[],[], {'seir_done',1}),
