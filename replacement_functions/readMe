The code now uses SP< linear registation for SPGR-SEIR alignment. 
The following function were replaced: 
mrQ_Call_AntsAlign_forSEIRMAP_SPGR_bb >> mrQ_Call_RigidAlign_forSEIRMAP_SPGR_bb
mrQ_ANTS_warp_SPGR2EPI >> mrQ_SPM_reg_SPGR2EPI
mrQ_ANTS_warp_EPI2SPGR >> mrQ_SPM_reg_EPI2SPGR (this also uses relaxFirstAlignAll instead of relaxAligAll). 

Further chemnges: 
mrQ_B1FitMask_bb: used the WARP to create a map for the B1 fit. That 
part is now commented. 

thoughts:
in the function mrQ_B1_LRFit
it might be beneficial to only use "good" ratios, with varience:
